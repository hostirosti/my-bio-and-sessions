## Sessions

### Global consistency at scale, breaking the RDBMs ceiling

In this presentation you'll learn how Cloud Spanner, a Google build horizontally scalable database differs from traditional RDBMS, how those differences enable unique capabilities, and how those can enable advanced application behaviors. We'll dive into the architecture of Cloud Spanner, show how to setup you first instance and database and walk you through design decisions when coming up with your first schema and queries that are enabled to scale to terabytes of data. Come prepared to see some code, queries and query explains.

### Optimizing applications, schemas and query design on Cloud Spanner

Cloud Spanner is a powerful product, but many users do not maximize its benefits. This talk highlights best practices, strategies for optimizing applications and workloads, and ways to improve performance and scalability. Through live demos, attendees will witness real-time speed-ups of transactions, queries, and overall performance. Additionally, this talk explores techniques for monitoring Cloud Spanner to identify performance bottlenecks. Come learn how to save thousands of dollars and maximize performance with Cloud Spanner.

### A new approach to data processing, streams and batch in one model

In this talk you will learn about Apache Beam. A project that came out of more than 10 years of experience with big data processing at Google. We will show you how you can get insights out of data streams and batched data in one model. Apache Beam allows you to run your data processing pipeline on many different runners including Google's managed Dataflow service. In this talk we'll demonstrate the capabilities of Apache Beam on Google Dataflow and the power of a fully managed, self-optimizing platform.

### Build and scale high performance applications with Google Cloud Platform

Through the likes of Compute & Container Engine, App Engine, Cloud Storage and BigQuery, Google Cloud Platform gives you access to the same state of the art high performance compute and network infrastructure that runs Google Search, GMail and YouTube. In this talk we'll take a look at how easy it is to use these services to harness the power of Google's Infrastructure for large scale and highly available applications. The 3rd wave of cloud computing is here to help you concentrate on what matters: "Building & Innovate" instead of "Running" your applications that enable your customers to stay informed and have access to important information anywhere in the world.

### Containers, Kubernetes and Google Cloud

Creating a single microservice is a well-understood challenge. Creating a cluster of load-balanced microservices that are resilient and self-healing is not so easy. Managing that cluster with rollouts and rollbacks, scaling individual services on demand, and securely sharing secrets and configuration among services is even harder. Kubernetes, an open-source container management system, can help with this. In this talk, we start with a simple microservice, containerize it using Docker, and scale it to a cluster of resilient microservices managed by Kubernetes. Along the way, we learn what makes Kubernetes a great system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications.

### Building applications for scalability while keeping costs at bay

Google Cloud Platform has a wide range of powerful products to offer, but many users donâ€™t know which to pick to set them up for success while keeping the bill at check. This talk highlights a path and strategies how to start with a small full stack application that is enabled to grow into a comprehensive, highly available and resilient application handling millions of qps. While we walk through the different stages, cost performance is always at the top of our minds. Through live demos and metrics, attendees will learn which trade-offs to consider between cost, performance, reliability and scalability.
